<h3><strong>I Love food. We love food. We all love food. We all are Food Mad.</strong></h3>
<p>This is going to be one of the most unique contests in the world around.  Just 

imagine that if we had an option to eat at an epic eatery, write a description of 

the place, the food, the owner, the history, the recipe & at the same time get paid 

for it ; would we will be less happy ?

The Food fever is on the rise. We will raise the temperatures further.  The recipe 

for success is this contest is very simple – The recipe of the place at which you are 

eating has to be very tasty.</p>
