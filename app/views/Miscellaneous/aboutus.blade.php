          We are living in the time when good is not good enough & even the brilliant gets cut throat competition. The times of ‘My son will become an engineer’ have changed into ‘My son is a wedding photographer now!’ .The times of ‘My daughter will become a good house wife’ have changed to ‘My daughter is an independent fashion designer now’.

           Reasons are many. Women especially in a country like ours feel empowered now. Private corporate sector unfortunately has made many youngsters realize the need to get out of the daily rites of a mundane life & do something for themselves. IPhone is the fashion today, and it costs 50000. So it’s affordable enough if one becomes a government servant earning 40000 p.m. without fearing the loss of job. But mostly, one ends up as a private sector employee flaunting that he belongs to the corporate culture with salary of Rs 15000 & working hours, something between 10-12 hours a day. Rarely one uses wisdom to do something which uses capabilities & transforms the person into a money making machine
